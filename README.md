## Init File

The Init file is a JSON file that has a list of Actions that will run one after another before the system goes up.  
to add a new action to the init file, you need to check its Use case Action class and find what arguments it should get.  
each use case has a Label parameter, which represent the 'returned value' to pass through to the next action.



### For Example


```json
 {
        "Type": "CreateStoreAction",
        "UserLabel": "Benny User",
        "Label" : "Rami Levi",
        "StoreToCreate": 
        {
           "StoreName": "Rami Levi",
           "Description": "Blah"
        }
  }
```

create store action need to get User label which represent the user that want to open a store, Label which will direct any future action to this store and some new store details. 



### Configuration file

The configuration file is "appsettings.{EnvironmentVariable}.json" and is applied depending on the environment variable set in the current system.
In every environment the settings are set to fit the needs of the environement.

### Jwt section:
The jwt secition has fields that are related to jwt token authenticatio×ž:
  Secret - The secret used to generate the tokens.
  TokenLifeTime - The token life time.
  RefreshTokenExpirationMonthsAmount - the refresh token life time.
  
## AppInitialization:
  SeedDummyData - Boolean field decided weither some dummy data is seeded contains a store and products for admin.
  AdminUserName - The username of the admin.
  AdminPassword - The password of the admin
  
## UseCases:
  RunUseCases - Boolean field deicdes weither the use cases are run.
  FilePath - The path of the use case file (init file).
  
## DbMode: 
 EfCore\InMemory decides weither the server is run with EntityFramework ORM or in memory.

## UseStubExternalSystems:
 Boolean field decides weither the server is run with stub external systems.
 
## ConnectionStrings:

## Serilog
  Log related configuration
  
example of a config file:
```
{
  "Jwt": {
    "Secret": "",
    "TokenLifeTime": "00:00:00",
    "RefreshTokenExpirationMonthsAmount": 1
  },
  "AppInitialization": {
    "SeedDummyData": false,
    "AdminUserName": "Admin",
    "AdminPassword": "Admin",
  },
  "UseCases": {
    "RunUseCases": false,
    "FilePath": "./usecases.json"
  },
  "DbMode": "EfCore",
  "UseStubExternalSystems": false,
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnectionString": ""
  },
  "Serilog": {
    "Using": [],
    "MinimumLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Override": {
        "Microsoft": "Warning",
        "System": "Warning",
        "Microsoft.Hosting": "Information"
      }
    },
    "Enrich": [ "FromLogContext", "WithMachineName", "WithProcessId" ],
    "WriteTo": [
      {
        "Name": "Console",
        "Args": {
          "theme": "Serilog.Sinks.SystemConsole.Themes.AnsiConsoleTheme::Code, Serilog.Sinks.Console",
          "outputTemplate": "[{Timestamp:HH:mm:ss} {Level:u3}] {Message:lj} <s:{SourceContext}>{NewLine}{Exception}"
        }
      },
      {
        "Name": "File",
        "Args": {
          "path": ".\\Logs\\log-.txt",
          "outputTemplate": "{Timestamp:G} {Message}{NewLine:1}{Exception:1}",
          "rollingInterval": "Day"
        }
      }
    ]

  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```

### Test configuration file
The file is a similar config file "appsettings.Test.json" that decides weither the the server runs tests on database\mocked and weither the server
runs with mocked\real external systems.
